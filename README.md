# TWICDBAggregator

This tool allows you to download all the TWIC issues at once between 2 dates and gather them in a big PGN file.

The credits should go to the authors who published the original version in google code.

I just fixed the code to support HTTPS and republished in GitHub.

You can download the program in this page:
